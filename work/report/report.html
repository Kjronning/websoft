<h2>S01</h2>
    <h3>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</h3>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p> We learned how to use git in a class called "object oriented programming" as part of our programme in software development
    in HKR. We learned how to set up a git repository, how to set up an origin, a master branch and other branches, committing,
        pushing, pulling, etc. All this using git bash.</p>

    <h4>Github</h4>
    <p>I learned github after learning how to use git bash, as you usually need a remote origin to be able to work in groups.
    I've used github extensively for most of my projects since then, since it's very nice to have a remote backup for your
    projects.</p>

    <h4>Markdown</h4>
    <p>Never heard of markdown before.</p>

    <h4>Github Pages</h4>
    <p>Never heard of this either.</p>

    <h3>Have you ever created websites before?</h3>
    <p>Yes, partly. I started learning React and made a website using it. I never went too much in depth and didn't even learn
    too much.

    I was interested to create a personal website since I have a lot of different projects and I wanted somewhere I could
    archive them and maybe inspire other people that might stumble upon them. For example, I used to write short stories
    and it would've been neat to be able to host the stories on there. I also had a few graphical implementations
    of software "challenges", like the knight's tour.

    In hindsight, some of the things I wanted for the website would've required learning javascript, which I did not have
    time for at that moment in my life.</p>

    <h3>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</h3>
    <p>I started a project to create my personal website using React. I forgot to add it to github and formatted my computer,
    losing all progress. It wasn't much, however so I don't mind it.

    I also know how to scrape websites, so I have some cursory knowledge in html structure. It didn't interest me too much
    when I learnt it, so I don't know all the different tags for HTML, but I know a few (href, li, a, etc).

    Besides that, I don't have a lot of knowledge on web development. I did try to learn javascript a while ago (trying to
    learn how to use flutter to create native apps for android and iOs), but coming from a heavy oop language like java, it
    was very difficult to wrap my head around it.</p>

    <h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
    <p>I learned how to link internal pages inside a project. I also learned how to use an index file.</p>
