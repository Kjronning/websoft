        <h3>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</h3>
        <h4>Git</h4>
        <p> We learned how to use git in a class called "object oriented programming" as part of our programme in
            software development
            in HKR. We learned how to set up a git repository, how to set up an origin, a master branch and other
            branches, committing,
            pushing, pulling, etc. All this using git bash.</p>

        <h4>Github</h4>
        <p>I learned github after learning how to use git bash, as you usually need a remote origin to be able to work
            in groups.
            I've used github extensively for most of my projects since then, since it's very nice to have a remote
            backup for your
            projects.</p>

        <h4>Markdown</h4>
        <p>Never heard of markdown before.</p>

        <h4>Github Pages</h4>
        <p>Never heard of this either.</p>

        <h3>Have you ever created websites before?</h3>
        <p>Yes, partly. I started learning React and made a website using it. I never went too much in depth and didn't
            even learn
            too much.

            I was interested to create a personal website since I have a lot of different projects and I wanted
            somewhere I could
            archive them and maybe inspire other people that might stumble upon them. For example, I used to write short
            stories
            and it would've been neat to be able to host the stories on there. I also had a few graphical
            implementations
            of software "challenges", like the knight's tour.

            In hindsight, some of the things I wanted for the website would've required learning javascript, which I did
            not have
            time for at that moment in my life.</p>

        <h3>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</h3>
        <p>I started a project to create my personal website using React. I forgot to add it to github and formatted my
            computer,
            losing all progress. It wasn't much, however so I don't mind it.

            I also know how to scrape websites, so I have some cursory knowledge in html structure. It didn't interest
            me too much
            when I learnt it, so I don't know all the different tags for HTML, but I know a few (href, li, a, etc).

            Besides that, I don't have a lot of knowledge on web development. I did try to learn javascript a while ago
            (trying to
            learn how to use flutter to create native apps for android and iOs), but coming from a heavy oop language
            like java, it
            was very difficult to wrap my head around it.</p>

        <h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
        <p>I learned how to link internal pages inside a project. I also learned how to use an index file.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <h3>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</h3>
        <p> I had never used HTML, but I knew about some of the tags because of web scraping.

            React uses similar styles to CSS, but it's definitely not the same, as you usually set the style with a
        name and then declare the styles into the components, whereas in CSS you declare which classes will use which styles.

        As a part of using flutter and React-Native it is good to learn to use javascript, and in the case of react-native
        it's basically mandatory. I did learn how to use functions, inner functions and the like, but the soft typing confused
        me a lot, especially coming from OOP hard typed languages.</p>

        <h3>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</h3>
        <p>HTML is the actual structure of the different components in a website, along with their contents. CSS takes care
        of the style, or how the website will look like. These two will generate static websites, however, and JavaScript is used
        to create dynamic websites.</p>

        <h3>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</h3>
        <p>By using HTTP, the browser and the server have a common "language" with which to communicate in a client-server pattern.
        The client requests information to the server, and the server replies with either the requested information (a code 200, OK response),
        or other error responses as to why it could not send the requested information (code 404 not found, code 403 forbidden, etc).
        Thus, both browsers and servers can use this "language" without worrying about mishaps in communication.</p>

        <h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
        <p>HTML and CSS are two distinct "procedures" that must be well complemented to make a website look good.</p>
