        <h3>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</h3>
        <h4>Git</h4>
        <p> We learned how to use git in a class called "object oriented programming" as part of our programme in
            software development
            in HKR. We learned how to set up a git repository, how to set up an origin, a master branch and other
            branches, committing,
            pushing, pulling, etc. All this using git bash.</p>

        <h4>Github</h4>
        <p>I learned github after learning how to use git bash, as you usually need a remote origin to be able to work
            in groups.
            I've used github extensively for most of my projects since then, since it's very nice to have a remote
            backup for your
            projects.</p>

        <h4>Markdown</h4>
        <p>Never heard of markdown before.</p>

        <h4>Github Pages</h4>
        <p>Never heard of this either.</p>

        <h3>Have you ever created websites before?</h3>
        <p>Yes, partly. I started learning React and made a website using it. I never went too much in depth and didn't
            even learn
            too much.

            I was interested to create a personal website since I have a lot of different projects and I wanted
            somewhere I could
            archive them and maybe inspire other people that might stumble upon them. For example, I used to write short
            stories
            and it would've been neat to be able to host the stories on there. I also had a few graphical
            implementations
            of software "challenges", like the knight's tour.

            In hindsight, some of the things I wanted for the website would've required learning javascript, which I did
            not have
            time for at that moment in my life.</p>

        <h3>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</h3>
        <p>I started a project to create my personal website using React. I forgot to add it to github and formatted my
            computer,
            losing all progress. It wasn't much, however so I don't mind it.

            I also know how to scrape websites, so I have some cursory knowledge in html structure. It didn't interest
            me too much
            when I learnt it, so I don't know all the different tags for HTML, but I know a few (href, li, a, etc).

            Besides that, I don't have a lot of knowledge on web development. I did try to learn javascript a while ago
            (trying to
            learn how to use flutter to create native apps for android and iOs), but coming from a heavy oop language
            like java, it
            was very difficult to wrap my head around it.</p>

        <h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
        <p>I learned how to link internal pages inside a project. I also learned how to use an index file.</p>
    </div>


    <button type="button" class="collapsible">S02</button>
    <div class="content">
        <h3>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</h3>
        <p> I had never used HTML, but I knew about some of the tags because of web scraping.

            React uses similar styles to CSS, but it's definitely not the same, as you usually set the style with a
            name and then declare the styles into the components, whereas in CSS you declare which classes will use
            which styles.

            As a part of using flutter and React-Native it is good to learn to use javascript, and in the case of
            react-native
            it's basically mandatory. I did learn how to use functions, inner functions and the like, but the soft
            typing confused
            me a lot, especially coming from OOP hard typed languages.</p>

        <h3>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</h3>
        <p>HTML is the actual structure of the different components in a website, along with their contents. CSS takes
            care
            of the style, or how the website will look like. These two will generate static websites, however, and
            JavaScript is used
            to create dynamic websites.</p>

        <h3>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</h3>
        <p>By using HTTP, the browser and the server have a common "language" with which to communicate in a
            client-server pattern.
            The client requests information to the server, and the server replies with either the requested information
            (a code 200, OK response),
            or other error responses as to why it could not send the requested information (code 404 not found, code 403
            forbidden, etc).
            Thus, both browsers and servers can use this "language" without worrying about mishaps in communication.</p>

        <h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
        <p>HTML and CSS are two distinct "procedures" that must be well complemented to make a website look good.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">S03</button>
    <div class="content">
        <h3>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>I had written one small script that helped with dice rolling, but I was thinking too much of writing it like
            an OOP
            script, not really knowing what to expect about JavaScript.</p>
        <h3>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</h3>
        <p>Not really. It somewhat resembles most languages in how you declare variables and functions, but I had never
            used a language
            where functions are objects. This makes it very flexible, but at the same time makes it hard to write clean
            code. </p>
        <h3>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out
            to be?</h3>
        <p>I tried to tackle the exercise in parts. Since I wanted to aim for a 5, I tackled first the duck script. When
            that was mostly done,
            I moved on to the school code. After I had successfully set up the functions to fetch the municipality
            information and load it to the table,
            I went on to do the flags portion. When I had finished the flags code, I went back to the duck code to
            finish some details and add it to my htmls.
            After that I downloaded a few municipality json files from the API and edited the municipality list
            accordingly.

            Because I want to learn how to use CSS and javascript effectively, I set up a few extra things that weren't
            part of the exercise,
            for example using toggles for the flags (with the toggles being mutually exclusive).

            I think my code overall turned really well. I believe it is easy to follow and without much repeat code.</p>
        <h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
        <p>Not only I learned about basic scripting, fetching information from files and manipulating html objects
            through javascript,
            I also learned why it's important to wrap your javascript files with an anonymous function, a practice
            called Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) </p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">S04</button>
    <div class="content">
       <h3>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</h3>
        <p>I had barely any experience using NPM. Mostly trying to get docker to work on a linux installation. I'd say that the Linux
        repository is very similar to NPM, with a different syntax. </p>
        <h3>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</h3>
        I think it was great! Express made it very easy to do server side code.
        As to node, I'd say it also makes things easier, except for using different JavaScript scripts. It was a bit tricky
        to understand the difference between importing and requiring and how to get everything to work. After that, however,
        it became very easy to use.
        JavaScript is very intuitive and the code you write just works. Too bad it's not very object oriented, but there
        are workarounds for that. I'd say all in all it is a good, simple combination to create server side applications.
        <h3>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</h3>
        <p>I literally had no plan. I read the assignment, looked through the code in the example and walked through the
        guide in the repo. I then tried my best to make it work and, as I mentioned before, struggled with using separate scripts
        at the beginning.</p>
        <h3>What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</h3>
        <p>I aimed for grade 5. The hardest part was actually getting everything to work for grade 3. Also understanding some of the instructions
        for example for grade 4: "Add the path lotto-json which produces a JSON response of the lotto draw.", were hard to understand. Grade 5
        was very straight forward.</p>
        <h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
        <p>I learned how to use Node and Express, creating a JavaScript based web server. I learned how to use require,
        exporting functions and routing.</p>
    </div>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">S05</button>
    <div class="content">
        <h3>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</h3>
        <p>To be blunt, I hate it. It's not particularly hard to use, but the syntax is complicated. Also the fact that
        you can do things either by object orientation or programmatically made it very hard to know what was happening and
        to look for solutions online.</p>
        <h3>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</h3>
        <p>Hard to say. It feels like a mixture between JavaScript and CSS.</p>
        <h3>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</h3>
        <p>I aimed for grade 5. I am satisfied with the result as I was able to separate the php code from the html code (for the most part)
        and I was able to come up with a solution that is intuitive and easy to use.</p>
        <h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
        <p>I learned how to code in PHP. It is a nightmare.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h3>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</h3>
        <p>I think popularity is a good measure to guide yourself into what languages are good to learn for when you start looking for work. However most languages
        are very similar so I don't think it's too important. Also you shouldn't rely too much on language popularity since it doesn't take new languages
        and their utility into account.
        I think Java's popularity will continue to decrease, especially considering that python has the tensorflow library and Machine Learning is becoming such an
        ubiquitous part of programming.</p>
        <h3>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</h3>
        <p>Whatever my boss requires me to learn. In all seriousness, whichever language is good for the task I'm doing. I don't think I'll ever stop using
        Java, for example, but I might start using Python 3 more often, as well as JavaScript.</p>
        <h3>Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.</h3>
        <p>I compared Java, JavaScript, Python, Php and C# worldwide for the past 5 years in programming. As I thought, Java's interest has been steadily declining, while Python has gone up
        and is now on par with the other three programming languages (Java is still at the top, though much lower than 5 years ago).</p>

        <h3>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</h3>
        <P>This is a trick question; I don't have nearly enough experience with large projects, or new languages or frameworks to just recommend them to the team :p</P>
        <h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
        <p>I learned to be more critical at looking at the differences between programming languages, and to see those differences as different pros and cons for
        different projects.</p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">S07</button>
    <div class="content">
        <h3>Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft
            technology.</h3>
        <p>The .NET platform is a framework for building websites using C# and ASP.NET. It merges html pages with C# functionality
        allowing you to use Object-oriented programming to dynamically set and change the contents of your website. This also includes
        API building with controllers and services and a clear separation of concerns.</p>
        <h3>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.</h3>
        <p>.NET looks to be more complete and comprehensive than any other technologies we've seen such as php and express. The ability
        to use C# code to change websites, along with strong object orientation for API and server functions makes it a very powerful
        framework to use.
        This power, however, comes with a big penalty in simplicity. The framework is very hard to understand if you don't follow the guides correctly
        or if you don't have someone teaching you. There are also many a functionality, and learning even the most simple structures will take some time. </p>
        <h3>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the
            result?</h3>
        <p>I aimed for grade 5. I am mostly satisfied, except that I couldn't link to routes in the navigation bar.</p>
        <h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
        <p>I learned how to use C# and ASP.NET for creating websites... somewhat. It looks like the framework is very complete and comprehensive,
            which would take a lot of time to learn how to use properly and efficiently. If I end up building websites I might look into it, since it's very strong.</p>

        <h3>Elaborate on a few (3-5) different security issues or concerns, from your own experience, related to web application security and relate them to the OWASP top ten.</h3>
        <p> Injection: Typical issue with mysql databases. It is a very common type of attack especially if people are careless about not sanitizing their queries. Unsurprisingly,
            this is the top 1 issue listed on the OWASP top ten.
            Sensitive data exposure: This is as simple as sending unencrypted login information to the server. If someone is able to get access to that database, then the login/password is compromised, posing huge security risks to the users.
            This ranks at 3 in the top ten, and can also include financial, healthcare, and other sensitive data.
            Using components with known vulnerabilities: I think for our project we are using some old or deprecated libraries, which to be honest is not great. This ranks at 9, but it can
            still be a big issue since these libraries are often difficult to replace and require extensive refactoring of the source code.
        </p>
        <h3>Summarize by providing your own guidelines to a new web programmer on the topic “The essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications”.</h3>
        <p> 1) Encrypt your data before sending it to the database. Even if someone gains access to the database, you can protect delicate information with encryption so that the attackers dont gain much information.
            2) Use up-to-date libraries. You want to use a specific library that gets the job done? Do a cursory google search first. Spend 10 minutes looking if its up to date and safe.
            3) SANITIZE YOUR DATABASE QUERIES. The least you can do is use prepared statements, and you should always use prepared statements.
            4) You can do a lot of processing server side. The bad thing about websites is that most, if not all your client side code is visible. A good way to hide your code (especially for encryption)
        is by sending the data and letting the server encrypt the data, hidden away from prying eyes.</p>
        <h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
        <p>I learned about vulnerabilities that can affect my websites. I also learned that there is an organization that keeps an eye on the biggest vulnerabilities that affect websites,
